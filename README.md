# Pokedex in Go

Pokedex in Go is my fifth [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
It's a command-line Pokedex written in Go that lets you explore locations, catch Pokemon, and build your collection using the PokeAPI.

Features:

- Browse location areas with pagination (map / mapb)
- Explore locations to discover Pokemon (explore)
- Catch Pokemon with randomized success rates (catch)
- View your caught Pokemon (pokedex) and inspect their stats (inspect)
- Built-in caching to minimize API calls
